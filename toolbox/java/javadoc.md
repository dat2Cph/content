# Java Doc dokumentation

One part of documentation is _internal_ documentation. Internal documentation is documentation which is written inside the program itself. The target group of this documentation is programmers.

Java was one of the first programming languages to come with a tool which can extract information in source comments and produce HTML based documentation from those comments.

Javadoc allow you to write comments associated with:

* Projects
* Packages
* Classes
* Methods
* Fields

All of the places makes sense, and we will look at them all.

The tool Javadoc processes the contents of the special comments to produce html.

It is possible for third party developers to make their own processing tools. We will use one that allow github like markdown syntax to stay consistent with our use of markdown and github in general (this is an advanced topic and not mandatory to use).

## Structure of a javadoc comment

The javadoc tool will process the comments on the form:

    /**
    Javadoc comments start with `/**`
    and ends as a normal comment 
    */
  
Inside the comments you can use special documentation tags to control how the final html is generated. The most commonly used tags are:

* @param name - comment about the parameter
* @return - comment about what the method returns
* @throws - comment about which exception is thrown
* @author - who wrote this class
* @version - what version of the class is this

When using git, both author and version are better tracked using the version history than through these tags.

A full description of tags is at this page at the [official java documentation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format)

### Documenting classes

The important thing to document about a class is

* it’s purpose (for what is it used)
* who uses it
* who makes objects from this class

For example, a comment for a servlet should say which jsp pages has forms that sends requests to this servlet, and which jsp pages it forwards to.

A domain class could document which database table it mirrors, and how/where it is instantiated - in the presentation layer, the database layer, or both.

### Documenting methods

When documenting a method, the focus is on describing these four aspects of a method:

* the parameters, what they are used for and if there are expected values (e.g. not null)
* the return value - how does it depend on the parameters and the state of the object
* state change - how does this method change the state of the object
* throws - if the method thows an exception, state under what condition it is thrown.

* * *

### Extra details (if needed)

### Documenting fields

When documenting a field, you specify

* modifier (specify deviatations from private and non-static, e.g. static or protected)
* data type
* name
* description of purpose

### Documenting packages

Documenting packages is done in a special file named “package-info.java”.

Such a file can be made using the usual netbeans “new” command. Package-info is one of the files that can be created under the Java category.

For packages you should document:

* its cohesion principle
* how the major classes work together

The cohesion priciple can for instance be that _this package contains the classes of the system’s domain layer_”.

Documenting how the major classes work together can often be illustrated using a sequence diagram.

### Overview documentation

The overview documentation should say how the various packages work together, and how key classes provide the coupling between the packages. This is documentation of the system architecture.
