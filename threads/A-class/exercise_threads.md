# Threads exercises

## exercises for monday/tuesday

All exercises should use Executors and not code with threads directly.

### Exercise 1.

- Write a proram where the main thread creates a number of tasks for an ExecutorService. The first task should print `AAA`, the next `BBB`,`CCC` etc. up to `ZZZ` (there are 25 characters in total). There should be 4 worker threads in the executor service.

### Exercise 2.

- Read up on the concept of 'synchronized' (for example this page "<http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/synchronized.html>").  
- Fix the below code so that the Counter classÂ´s increment method is thread safe:
```java
private static class Counter {
        private int count = 0;

        public void increment() {
            count++;
        }

        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }
```

### Exercise 3.
- Look at the code in this class: https://github.com/HartmannDemoCode/ThreadsDemo/blob/main/src/main/java/dk/cphbusiness/exercises/AddingNumbers.java. It inserts a number into an ArrayList and prints out the size of the list. The list does not always contain a thousand numbers. Why is that? Propose a solution. 
- See if you can come up with a solution that does not use synchronized.

### Exercise 4.
Most operating systems have a program that shows the performance of the system (windows: taskmanager, mac: activity monitor, linux: System Monitor).
Create a variation of one of the Executor programs that puts all your cores to work and show us the result at the review.

### Exercise 5. (ekstra)

- Look at this [list](http://www.javainterview.in/p/java-synchronization-interview-questions.html) of questions for general knowledge about threads. There are new areas here that you can explore on your own if you have time and energy :-)

## Exercises wednesday/thursday

Exercises for thursday is to reprogram our web server from last week so that it becomes more responsive (more quickly becomes ready for next request).

### Exercise 1.

Based on the `RequestDataServer` from last weeks demo code (network and sockets) we make small changes to run each server response in a new thread. You need an ExecutorService that you insert just before the while loop (the one called `workingJack` in the example below). After the while loop comes `Socket socket = server.accept();` which is a blocking call that waits for a new request from a client/browser.

Then we take all the code from the try-catch block and move it into a separate method (HINT: Refactor -> Extract -> Method: Give the method a name. Below we have called it `MakeResponse`). Now we only have a single method call under the line that creates a socket. This line can now be inserted into a run method inside an anonymous implementation of the interface: Runnable like this:

```java
...
Socket socket = server.accept();
workingJack.submit(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    try {
                        MakeResponse(socket, root);
                    } catch (IOException ex) {
                        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
                    }
                }
            });
```

In this way all responses that the server needs to make will be put out in another thread, so that the main thread will be ready to wait for a new request from a browser as soon as possible.


### Exercise 2.
Now look at the `RequestFileServer` from last weeks demo code. Make changes to the code so that there
- will be a task and executor that returns files - a bit like the previous exercise.

### Exercise 3.
- Building on the previous exercise, try to make changes so that the `generateRequestObject()` method is run in a separate thread.

### Exercise 4.
- Make changes to `RequestDataClient` so that it can send multiple requests to the server. The requests should be sent in separate threads.
- Make a Junit test that tests that the server can handle multiple requests at the same time.
