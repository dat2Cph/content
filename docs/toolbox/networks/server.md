# What is a server?

A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In many cases, a server is a dedicated hardware device with the primary function of hosting services and managing network resources. However, a server can also be a software system running on a computer that enables it to manage network resources and provide services.

Servers are designed to handle requests from clients and deliver the appropriate response or service. These services can include sharing data, resources, and applications, or performing computations for the client. Depending on the service provided, servers can be classified into various types, such as:
